// Product edition: the full app versus the Steam Next Fest demo (issue #495).
//
// The demo is the same build narrowed to one curated model download and five
// curated conversations, with the rest of the surface hidden. Two signals say
// which edition this is, and they are set together by the demo build leg of the
// release workflow:
//
//   • VITE_CONVSIM_EDITION=demo — baked into this bundle at build time. It is
//     the primary signal for the UI, so the demo never flashes full-app chrome
//     before the engine answers.
//   • CONVSIM_EDITION=demo on convsim-core — reported by GET /api/health as
//     `edition` and `demo`. It is the primary signal for *data*: the engine
//     serves only the five conversations and the one model regardless of what
//     the UI asks for, and it tells the UI which five those are.
//
// The curated list is deliberately NOT duplicated here: the UI renders whatever
// the engine reports under `demo.scenario_ids`, so the five are curated in one
// place (convsim_core/edition.py). In dev, running the engine with
// CONVSIM_EDITION=demo is enough to see the demo UI — the build-time flag is
// optional there because the server's answer takes over once it arrives.
